# Biodiversity in National Parks

## Project Overview
This project analyzes biodiversity in U.S. national parks, specifically focusing on endangered species. Using data from the **National Parks Service**, the goal is to identify patterns in conservation status, determine which species are at risk, and explore trends across different national parks.

This project was inspired by real-world datasets but consists of **fictionalized** data provided by Codecademy.

## Research Questions
The analysis addresses the following key questions:
1. **What is the distribution of conservation status for animals?**
2. **Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?**
3. **Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?**
4. **Which species were spotted the most at each park?**

## Dataset
The project utilizes two datasets:
- `Observations.csv` - Contains observations of different species recorded in various national parks.
- `Species_info.csv` - Provides information on species, including their conservation status.

**Dataset Summary:**
- **Total species:** 5,824
- **Species with conservation status:** 191
- **Endangered species:** 16 (primarily mammals)

## Key Findings
- Only **191 species** had a conservation status assigned, leaving **a large portion of species unclassified**.
- **Mammals are the most endangered category**, followed by birds and fish.
- The **most observed species** across all national parks were **Brachythecium Moss** and **Dicran Moss**.
- Yellowstone National Park had the highest number of observations for **Dicran Moss**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data exploration and visualization
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis** (handling missing values, statistical insights)

## National Parks Analyzed
- Bryce National Park
- Great Smoky Mountains National Park
- Yellowstone National Park
- Yosemite National Park

## Next Steps
- Improve data quality by addressing missing conservation statuses.
- Expand the analysis to include trends over time.
- Implement machine learning models to predict conservation risk.
